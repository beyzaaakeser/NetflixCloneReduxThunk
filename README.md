<h1>My Movie Website - Redux Thunk</h1>

A Netflix-like movie application allows users to explore a wide range of movies and view details about the movies they want. The application was developed using React and Redux technologies, and data was extracted from the API with Axios. Movies are sorted by genre, allowing users to quickly discover according to their interests. Each movie's detail page includes information such as content, language, category, production company, budget, and actors, as well as the React Player, which allows users to watch trailers. Using Redux and redux-thunk, the status of the application is managed centrally, allowing users to add the movies they want to their watch lists. Users can easily find the movies they want and access detailed information, allowing them to embark on a pleasant journey in the world of cinema.
